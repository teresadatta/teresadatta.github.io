Howdy! I'm Teresa- a Machine Learning Engineer at [**Arthur**](https://www.arthur.ai/) interested in transparency and social impact of algorithmic systems from a **human-centered, sociotechnical lens**. Recently, I've worked on XAI and HCI projects with the [AI4LIFE](https://twitter.com/ai4life_harvard?lang=en) and [DtAK](https://dtak.github.io/) labs while completing my M.S. in Data Science at Harvard University. I received my B.A. in Chemistry summa cum laude from Cornell University.

Check out my [publications](https://teresadatta.github.io/publications/).

Previously, I've had the pleasure of completing summer internships at Meta, Johnson & Johnson R&D, and Spotify.

I am passionate about public service, advocacy, and Diversity & Inclusion. I serve on the core team for the global [WiDS (Women in Data Science) datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html), have volunteered as a data scientist for small political campaigns through [Bluebonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/), and have served as the Lead Chair of the Harvard IACS Advisory Committee for Diversity, Inclusion, & Leadership.
