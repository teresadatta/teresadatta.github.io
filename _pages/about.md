Howdy! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Arthur](https://www.arthur.ai/) interested in transparency and social impact of algorithmic systems from a human-centered, sociotechnical lens. Previously, I've worked on XAI and HCI projects with the [AI4LIFE](https://twitter.com/ai4life_harvard?lang=en) and [DtAK](https://dtak.github.io/) labs while completing my M.S. in Data Science at Harvard University. I received my B.A. in Chemistry summa cum laude from Cornell University.
